# TAIRP-Image-gallery-filtering
Develop an image gallery with filter options such as categories or tags. Users can filter the images based on specific criteria, such as nature, animals, or cityscapes. Use HTML to structure the gallery, CSS to style the layout and effects, and JavaScript to handle the filtering functionality.
